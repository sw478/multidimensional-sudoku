This project is based off of the main sudoku project, as most of the code is reusable. It generalizes the ideas of a traditional 9x9 sudoku to sudokus of any dimension, of any size.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysection{general notes}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md50}

\item Use the \char`\"{}test.\+sh\char`\"{} bash script to run program
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}b\+:basic\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Sample sudokus are in /samples.
\item Using \href{https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html\#:~:text=zChaff\%20is\%20an\%20implementation\%20of,variables\%20and\%2010\%20million\%20clauses.}{\texttt{ zchaff}} for b\+Sat. b\+Sat usage is only loosely integrated at the moment for testing.
\item The generator can write to the sudoku\+File for the solver, or you can replace the sudoku\+File with your own sudoku puzzle to solve.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Solve\+: solve sudoku located in sudoku\+File. If sudoku doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist, generate one first, or copy a sample puzzle from /samples into sudoku\+File.
\item Generate\+: generate sudoku, input is just container dimensions.
\item Enumerate\+: enumerate all sudokus of a given dimensions. Don\textquotesingle{}t expect this finish on anything other than small sudokus (largest\+: \mbox{[}2, 2\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}3, 2\mbox{]}). Meant for analyzing all 288 \mbox{[}2, 2\mbox{]} sudokus.
\item b\+Sat\+: create a dimacs file for inputed dimensions, then run zchaff on dimacs file. Doesn\textquotesingle{}t do anything other than spit out SAT/\+UNSAT. Plan to expand on this functionality.

\item The program reads from a file containing the sudoku (sudoku\+File) to solve,
\item as well as a file (matrix\+File) that contains coordinates for the dancing links matrix.
\item If the correct matrix\+File does not exist yet, \mbox{\hyperlink{matrix_file_creator_8py}{matrix\+File\+Creator.\+py}} can be used to create it.
\item The generator can write to the sudoku\+File for the solver to solve.
\item Algorithm X is run on the matrix.
\item A solution tree is created, identifying the solution(s).

\item The program reads from a file (matrix\+File) that contains coordinates for the dancing links matrix.
\item If the correct matrix\+File does not exist yet, \mbox{\hyperlink{matrix_file_creator_8py}{matrix\+File\+Creator.\+py}} can be used to create it.
\item Algorithm X is run on the matrix to pick a single random solution (full sudoku).
\item Hide is initialized with the solved board.
\item Generate() is run to create a puzzle (partial sudoku) with the solved board as the only solution.
\item Newly created puzzle is saved in sudoku\+File.
