# Automated Configuration Library files for Sat4j

Those files were created to describe Sat4j during the [Configurable SAT Solver Challenge 2013](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/CSSC2013/).

They should be compatible with the more recent [Algorithm Configuration Library](http://www.aclib.net/).
